# SalesforceReport2Sheets
Test little project: an extension to import a tabular Salesforce report into a Google Sheet using the API. Will hopefully click an adjacent tab that has a Salesforce tabular report up, click the "Extract .CSV" option, download and hold that in memory (or read to disk, whateva), and API upload to a waiting Google Sheet in a tab.
